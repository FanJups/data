=== Test property reference

In the previous sections, there were sample configurations that contained information about
the different system properties that can be set under the `<systemPropertyVariables>` of the Surefire plugin. 
This section contains a complete list of the system properties that will be looked up by the TCK
and a short description of what data each represents. 
Use this reference as a quick guide for customizing how this TCK is run for your implementation.
