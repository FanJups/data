===== Entity Modes

There are situations where we need to test entities from a specific provider, 
and other times where the test is generalized to work for any provider.

To accomplish this tests are tagged with either the `persistence` group, `nosql` group, or no entity group.

When configuring Junit5 exclude the group name for the Entity type your provider does not support.
